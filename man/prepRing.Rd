\title{Create ringData structure for fitting distance models}
\usage{
prepRing(shapeLayout, scVar = NULL, notSearched = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{scVar}{(optional) name of a column with search class delineator in
\code{site_layout$layout}.}

\item{notSearched}{name(s) of the search classes that are not searched
(vector of character strings)}

\item{site_layout}{a \code{shapeLayout} object, which summarizes the spatial
characteristics of the site as listed in the associated GIS shape files
(search area polygons, turbine centers, and carcass discovery locations)}
}
\value{
List containing:
 \describe{
   \item{\code{$rdat}}{data frame with a turbine-aggregated layout with distance
     (outer radius of 1m rings), carcass counts, exposure (area seached in
     each ring), and an optional search class column;}
   \item{code{$rA}}{list of turbines with the area searched in at each
     distance from 1 to maximim distance searched at any turbine;}
   \item{\code{$srad}}{maximum distance searched at any turbine (numeric
     scalar);}
   \item{\code{$scVar}}{name of the search class column (if any);}
   \item{\code{$ncarc}}{number of carcasses found at each turbine (vector}
 }
}
\description{
Create necessary data structures from \code{shapeLayout} object
 for modeling carcass density as a function of distance from turbine and for
 modeling DWP.
